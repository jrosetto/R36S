ROCKNIX Nightly B overlay for Y3506_V03_20241210 Board with Panel 5.  Currently working on ROCKNIX-RK3326.aarch64-20260202-b.img.gz.  Also make sure you make extlinux.conf.r36s as the default in the extlinux folder by renaming it to extlinux.conf.
After the system boots you will need to assign all controls to Rocknix and Retroarch.
